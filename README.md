# ESP8266 IoT Examples

Welcome to the ESP8266 IoT Examples repository! This repository contains a collection of example codes and projects designed to showcase the capabilities of the ESP8266 microcontroller in various IoT applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each containing a specific example project. The folders are named sequentially for easy navigation:

- **01-WiFiParameters**: Example code to print various Wi-Fi parameters, including BSSID, RSSI, encryption type, and network scan results.
- **02-SignalStrengthLED**: Example code to adjust the brightness of the built-in LED based on the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) from the Wi-Fi network.

## Prerequisites

Before you start with the examples, ensure you have the following:

1. **ESP8266 Microcontroller**: 
   - Youâ€™ll need an ESP8266 board, such as the NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini. These are widely available and inexpensive.

2. **Arduino IDE**:
   - Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) if you haven't already.

3. **ESP8266 Board Support Package**:
   - Install the ESP8266 board package in the Arduino IDE. You can do this by navigating to `Tools > Board > Boards Manager`, searching for "ESP8266," and installing the package.

4. **USB Cable**:
   - Use a USB cable to connect your ESP8266 to your computer. Make sure the cable is suitable for data transfer, not just charging.

5. **Wi-Fi Network Information**:
   - For examples that require Wi-Fi connectivity, have your Wi-Fi SSID (network name) and password ready.

6. **Basic Knowledge of Arduino IDE**:
   - Familiarize yourself with the basics of using the Arduino IDE, including uploading sketches and opening the Serial Monitor.
